# Hotel-Project
A multi-threaded console application simulating a distributed hotel booking network

//***************Details****************//
Program.cs is where the main() funciton lives.
No input, no user interface. Output is simply the threads writing and reading data. 



//***************Bugs********************//
The output needs to have the correct charge associted with the "order". Fix will likely be in OrderProcessing.cs or HotelSupplier.cs



//***************Improvements************//
Needs some kind of user interface
Thread management should be looked at
